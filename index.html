        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>Don't knock on my biology degree just yet! Five years ago, I entered the tech field as a consultant, providing desktop support for hundreds of end-users from companies such as Indiana University Health and General Electric Company.
          I am now working in infrastructure operations as a system administrator, but the learning never stops! I'm interested in web design, programming, and applying all of my knowledge to cloud-based solutions!</p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I had an interested in being behind the camera from a very young age. When I was old enough to handle my parents' camera, I helped out with the family pictures.
           In my senior year of high school, I became an editor for my school's yearbook, and was lead photographer for covering football games and band events. I eventually became a known cosplay photographer in the Southeast United States, where I took on clients from locations such as New York City, Baltimore, Atlanta, and Orlando.</p>

        <h3>Kendo</h3>
        <p>I am currently registered in the All United States Kendo Federation with the Atlanta Kendo Kai. Since my brief return, I ascended to the rank of 1-kyu. I'm currently in another hiatus period, but kendo in itself is a life-long journey!</p>
